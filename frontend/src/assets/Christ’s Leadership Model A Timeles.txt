Christ’s Leadership Model: A Timeless Standard

In a world filled with shifting leadership styles, Christ’s model remains quietly revolutionary.

He led with humility, served without seeking recognition, empowered the overlooked, and stayed anchored in purpose. His strength wasn’t in authority—it was in compassion, truth, and sacrificial love.

Whether you lead a team, a family, or a company, His example reminds us that influence starts with integrity and service, not title or status.

What would leadership look like today if we followed His example more closely?
