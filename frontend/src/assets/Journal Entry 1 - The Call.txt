Journal Entry 1 - The Call
March 15, 2024
Got the call today. Michael ships out in two weeks.
The Army doesn't waste time with pleasantries - "Your son's unit has received deployment orders for the Middle East. Duration: 12-15 months." Just like that, everything changes.
Sarah cried. I held her, but inside I was screaming at God. Why now? Why my boy? He's only 22. Still calls me "Dad" when he's scared, though he'd never admit it.
I keep thinking about Abraham and Isaac. "Take your son, your only son, whom you love..." But God stopped Abraham's hand. Will He stop these wars? Will He bring my son home?
The congregation doesn't know yet. How do I preach about trusting God when my own faith feels like sand running through my fingers? How do I stand in that pulpit Sunday and talk about God's protection when I'm sending my child into harm's way?
I opened to Matthew 24 tonight without meaning to. "You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come."
Must happen. The words feel heavy tonight.
Michael called after dinner. His voice sounded different - older somehow. "Dad, I need you to be proud of me."
"I am, son. I always have been."
But pride and peace are not the same thing.
Lord, I don't understand Your timing. I don't understand why young men must go to war while old men argue about prophecy. Help me find the words this Sunday. Help me find the faith.
The world feels darker tonight. Come quickly, Lord Jesus.
