Journal Entry - Finding Peace in Questions.txt
Personal Journal Entry
September 3, 2024

Six months since the diagnosis, and I'm beginning to make peace with not having answers.

Mom's responding well to treatment - better than doctors expected. The latest scans show significant shrinkage, and her energy is returning. I should be celebrating, and part of me is. But another part of me is wrestling with questions that won't let go.

Why is Mom improving when my friend David's wife didn't? They had the same type of cancer, diagnosed around the same time. Janet fought just as hard, prayed just as faithfully, had just as much support. She died last month.

At Janet's funeral, David pulled me aside. "Don't you dare feel guilty about your mom getting better," he said. "God's grace looks different for different people, but it's still grace."

I've been thinking about that conversation for weeks. David's right, but it raises uncomfortable questions about divine will, healing, and why some prayers seem answered while others don't.

I used to think faithful pastors should have this figured out. That if I studied enough theology, prayed hard enough, and trusted completely enough, I'd understand God's ways. The prosperity gospel promises cause-and-effect spirituality: right faith yields right outcomes.

But real life is messier than that. Good people suffer. Bad people prosper. Prayers go unanswered despite great faith. Miracles happen to people who barely believe.

I'm learning that maybe the questions themselves are part of faith, not evidence against it. Job never got answers to his "why" questions, but he encountered God in a deeper way. The disciples asked Jesus why a man was born blind, and Jesus redirected them from theological speculation to practical compassion.

Maybe I've been asking the wrong questions. Instead of "Why do some people get healed and others don't?" maybe I should ask "How can I love well in the midst of uncertainty?" Instead of "Why does God allow suffering?" maybe "How can I be present to others in their pain?"

I'm starting to think that faith isn't about having answers but about trusting God's character when answers don't come. It's not about understanding His ways but about believing He is good even when His ways are mysterious.

This shift is changing how I pastor. Instead of offering theological explanations for people's suffering, I'm learning to sit with them in their questions. Instead of defending God's reputation, I'm trusting that He can handle honest doubt and raw emotion.

Mom's improvement is a gift I don't take for granted. But I'm also learning that God's goodness isn't dependent on the outcomes I prefer. His love is bigger than my understanding of how that love should be expressed.

I'm finding unexpected peace in this tension - believing deeply while questioning honestly, trusting God's heart when I can't trace His hand.

Tonight I'm grateful for the journey, even the hard parts. For Mom's improvement, for David's wisdom, for Janet's legacy of faith despite unanswered prayers. For the reminder that God is bigger than my theology, more mysterious than my understanding, and more loving than my fears.
