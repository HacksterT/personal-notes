Two months into Mom's treatment and I'm learning things about myself I didn't want to know.

I'm a control freak.

I've been trying to manage Mom's healing like I manage everything else - with plans, research, and sheer determination. I've read every article about her type of cancer, interviewed three different oncologists, and created spreadsheets tracking her symptoms and medication schedules.

Sarah finally called me out on it yesterday: "You can't control this, you know. You can't research your way to a guaranteed outcome."

She's right. And I hate that she's right.

I realized I've been treating God like a divine vending machine. Insert enough prayer, add sufficient faith, deliver optimal theological arguments, and receive desired healing. When the treatments didn't work as quickly as I hoped, I assumed I wasn't praying hard enough, believing correctly enough, or surrendering completely enough.

But watching Mom through this process has taught me something about letting go. She's not trying to control the outcome. She's taking treatment seriously but holding the results loosely. She has peace I don't understand.

"I've lived a good life," she told me today. "If God heals me, I'll be grateful. If He calls me home, I'll be ready. Either way, I'm His."

How does she do that? How does she live with such open hands when I'm white-knuckling everything?

I think this is what Jesus meant about His yoke being easy. I've been carrying burdens I was never meant to bear - the burden of controlling outcomes, of guaranteeing results, of being strong enough to fix everything.

Maybe faith isn't about having enough power to change circumstances. Maybe it's about finding peace within circumstances I can't change.

I'm trying to learn to pray differently. Instead of demanding specific outcomes, I'm asking for grace to trust God's goodness regardless of outcomes. Instead of presenting Him with my plan and asking for His blessing, I'm trying to say "Your will be done" and actually mean it.

It's harder than it sounds. But I'm starting to think this might be what spiritual maturity looks like - not having all the answers, but trusting the One who does.

Praying tonight for grace to let go. For wisdom to know the difference between what I can control and what I need to surrender. For Mom's peace to somehow become mine too.

Lord, I'm learning to trust You with outcomes I can't control. It's scary and difficult and goes against every instinct I have. But I want to find the rest You promise. Help me release what was never mine to hold in the first place.
