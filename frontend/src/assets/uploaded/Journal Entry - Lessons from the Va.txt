Journal Entry - Lessons from the Valley
Personal Journal Entry
November 18, 2024
A year ago, I thought I understood what it meant to trust God. I had sermons about faith, could quote verses about His faithfulness, and genuinely believed in His goodness. But this year taught me the difference between knowing about trust and actually trusting.
Mom's latest scans came back clear. The doctors are using words like "remission" and "remarkable recovery." She's back to gardening, cooking for half the neighborhood, and gently scolding me for worrying too much. Watching her strength return has been one of the most beautiful things I've ever experienced.
But the real transformation happened in me during the valley months, not on this mountain top.
I learned that faith isn't the absence of doubt but the decision to trust despite doubt. That peace isn't the absence of questions but the presence of God in the midst of questions. That strength isn't about having all the answers but about admitting when you don't know and leaning on Someone who does.
The sermons I've preached since Mom's diagnosis have been different. More honest. Less polished. Instead of offering neat theological packages, I'm sharing the messy reality of walking with God through uncertainty. The congregation seems to connect with this authenticity in ways they never did with my more academic presentations.
Last week, a young mother approached me after church. Her husband was just diagnosed with the same condition Mom had. "Thank you for talking about the hard questions," she said. "I was starting to think something was wrong with my faith because I couldn't stop wondering where God was in all this."
I was able to sit with her in a way I couldn't have before Mom's illness. Not offering easy answers or false comfort, but honest solidarity. "The questions don't mean your faith is weak," I told her. "Sometimes they mean it's growing."
This experience has changed not just how I pastor but how I see my calling. I used to think my job was to have answers, to be strong for everyone else, to represent unwavering faith in all circumstances. Now I think it's more about being real - sharing the journey of faith honestly, including the parts that are hard and confusing.
I'm working on a sermon series about finding God in dark seasons. Not theoretical stuff, but the real theology that emerges from walking through valleys. I want to talk about:

How to pray when prayers feel empty
Why good people suffer and how that doesn't negate God's goodness
The difference between faith and optimism
How community carries us when individual faith falters

I'm also thinking about the study notes I've been keeping throughout this process. The Greek word studies, the exegesis work, the wrestling with passages that took on new meaning. Maybe these could help others who are walking similar paths.
Looking back, I see God's presence throughout this year in ways I missed at the time:

In the initial shock and fear that drove me to my knees
In the questions that deepened rather than destroyed my faith
In the community that surrounded our family
In Mom's example of grace under pressure
In the way this experience is shaping my ministry

I wouldn't choose to repeat this year, but I wouldn't trade what I learned either. The valley taught me things about God's character that the mountaintop never could. It stripped away superficial faith and revealed something more solid underneath.
Mom's recovery is a gift I'll never take for granted. But the deeper gift is what happened to my soul during the uncertain months - learning to find God not in spite of the darkness but within it.
Tonight I'm grateful for the full journey - the fear and the healing, the questions and the gradual answers, the valley and this current view from higher ground. Most of all, I'm grateful for a God who meets us wherever we are and loves us enough to not leave us unchanged.
Lord, thank You for walking through this valley with us. Thank You for Mom's healing, but even more, thank You for Your presence during the months when healing seemed uncertain. Use what I've learned to help others find You in their own dark seasons. Keep me humble, honest, and dependent on You.
