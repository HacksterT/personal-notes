Journal Entry - Mom's Diagnosis
Personal Journal Entry
March 15, 2024

Got the call today. Cancer.

I knew something was wrong when Mom asked me to come to the doctor's appointment with her. She never asks for help. Never admits weakness. But sitting in that sterile office, hearing the doctor use words like "aggressive" and "treatment options," I watched her shrink into herself.

I'm supposed to be the pastor. The one with faith. The one who has answers about God's goodness and sovereignty. But driving home, all I could think was "Where are you, God?"

It's not that I don't believe. It's that believing feels complicated right now. I've preached about God's healing power, about His love, about how He works all things together for good. I still believe those things are true. But today they feel like doctrine rather than comfort.

Mom was quiet on the drive home. I kept glancing at her, this woman who raised me to trust God, who taught me to pray, who never missed church in my entire childhood. She was staring out the window with tears on her cheeks.

"Do you think I did something wrong?" she asked quietly.

Wrong? This woman who has loved God and served others her entire life? Who gave sacrificially to missions, who opened our home to anyone in need, who prayed for me every single day? The question broke something in me.

"No, Mom. This isn't about what you did or didn't do."

But even as I said it, I wondered: Why do the faithful suffer? Why do the prayers of righteous people sometimes seem to hit the ceiling? Why does a God who promises to heal sometimes allow disease to ravage the bodies of those who love Him most?

I don't have answers tonight. Just questions. And a strange sense that maybe that's okay. Maybe faith isn't about having all the answers. Maybe it's about trusting God even when the questions multiply.

I'm going to call Pastor Williams tomorrow. He walked through this with his wife five years ago. Maybe he can help me figure out how to be strong for Mom while falling apart inside.

For now, I'm going to sit with the questions. And pray, even though prayer feels different tonight. Less certain, more desperate. Maybe that's not a bad thing.

Lord, I don't understand. But I'm going to keep believing You're good, even when I can't see it. Help me be what Mom needs. Help me trust when trust is hard.
