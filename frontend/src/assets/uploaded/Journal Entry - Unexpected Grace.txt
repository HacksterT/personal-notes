Journal Entry - Unexpected Grace
Personal Journal Entry
July 8, 2024

God showed up today in the most unexpected way.

Mom had a rough treatment session yesterday - nausea, exhaustion, discouragement. She's usually so positive, but last night she admitted she was starting to wonder if the fight was worth it.

This morning I went to pick up her prescriptions, dreading another day of watching her suffer. The pharmacy was busy, and I was frustrated with the wait when the woman behind me tapped my shoulder.

"Excuse me, aren't you Pastor Johnson from Trinity Church?"

I turned around to see Martha Stevens, whose husband I buried three years ago. She looked at the prescription bag in my hand and somehow just knew.

"It's your mom, isn't it?"

I nodded, suddenly fighting back tears. Here I was, supposed to be the one offering comfort to others, and I was falling apart in the pharmacy line.

Martha didn't say much. She just pulled out her phone and showed me a picture of her grandson - the one she never thought she'd meet because the doctors gave her six months to live. That was four years ago.

"I'm not saying your mom's story will be the same as mine," she said gently. "But I am saying God's not done writing it yet."

Then she hugged me right there in the pharmacy, and I let myself cry on the shoulder of a woman I was supposed to be pastoring.

When I got to Mom's house, I found her sitting on the porch with Mrs. Chen from next door. Apparently Mrs. Chen had brought homemade soup and stayed to visit. They were laughing about something - actually laughing - for the first time in weeks.

"Your mom was just telling me about the time you tried to baptize the cat when you were five," Mrs. Chen said with a grin.

For the next hour, I listened to stories I'd never heard - about Mom's childhood, her dreams, her fears, her hopes. Mrs. Chen shared about her own journey through her husband's illness last year. Two women, different faiths, different backgrounds, but connected by the universal experience of facing uncertainty with courage.

As I drove home tonight, I realized God had answered my prayers today - just not how I expected. I'd been praying for healing, for strength, for clear direction. Instead, He sent Martha with hope, Mrs. Chen with laughter, and both of them with the reminder that we don't walk difficult roads alone.

Maybe this is how God often works - not through dramatic interventions but through ordinary people showing up at exactly the right moment with exactly what we need.

I'm starting to see grace everywhere now that I'm looking for it:
- In nurses who take extra time to explain procedures
- In friends who bring meals without being asked
- In strangers who smile kindly when they see Mom's headscarf
- In moments of laughter that break through the worry

God hasn't healed Mom yet. But He's been healing something in me - the illusion that I have to face this alone, that being strong means not needing help, that faith means having all the answers.

Tonight I'm grateful for unexpected grace, for God who shows up in pharmacy lines and porch conversations, for the reminder that His presence is often hidden in the kindness of others.

Lord, thank You for showing up today through Martha and Mrs. Chen. Help me keep my eyes open for the ways You're working, even when they don't look like what I expected. Give me grace to receive help as readily as I try to offer it.
