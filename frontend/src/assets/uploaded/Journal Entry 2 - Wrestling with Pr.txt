Journal Entry 2 - Wrestling with Prophecy
March 28, 2024
Two weeks since Michael left. The house feels empty even when it's full.
I've been studying end times passages all week, trying to make sense of what's happening in the world. Ukraine, Gaza, tensions rising everywhere. Michael's somewhere in that mess now, and I can't even talk to him.
The prophecy books on my shelf suddenly feel different. Not academic anymore. Personal. When Daniel writes about "a time of trouble such as never was," I think about my son checking for IEDs. When Jesus warns of wars and earthquakes, I scroll through news feeds looking for his unit's location.
Had coffee with Bob Henderson this morning. His grandson was deployed last year. "You learn to pray differently," he told me. "Less theology, more desperation."
He's right. My prayers have become primitive. Raw. "Keep him safe. Bring him home. Please, God, bring him home."
I've been wrestling with Revelation 6 - the four horsemen. War, famine, pestilence, death. Are we watching prophecy unfold? Are these the birth pains Jesus talked about?
Sarah thinks I'm becoming obsessed. Maybe I am. But when your child is in the middle of what might be end times events, how do you not become obsessed?
The congregation has been asking about a prophecy series. "Pastor, what's happening in the world? Are we in the last days?" They want answers I don't have. They want hope when I'm barely holding onto my own.
Maybe that's the point. Maybe this is how God prepares His messengers - by breaking them first.
Found myself reading 1 Thessalonians 4 tonight: "For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first."
What if Jesus comes back before Michael comes home? Would that be mercy or heartbreak?
I don't know anymore. I just know I miss my boy.
