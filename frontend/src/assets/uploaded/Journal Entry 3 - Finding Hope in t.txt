Journal Entry 3 - Finding Hope in the Darkness
April 10, 2024
Got a video call from Michael yesterday. He looked tired but alive. That's enough for now.
He told me about a chaplain there - Army Captain Jenkins. Lost his father in Afghanistan fifteen years ago. "Dad," Michael said, "he talks about heaven differently than you do. Like it's real. Like it's home."
That hit me hard. How do I talk about heaven? Like a theological concept? A distant hope? Or like the place where this broken world finally gets fixed?
I've been preparing this prophecy series for weeks now, wrestling with war and rumors of war, trying to make sense of suffering. But maybe I've been approaching it backwards.
Maybe the point isn't to understand why bad things happen. Maybe the point is to remember where they're leading.
Started reading Revelation 21 this morning: "He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away."
No more war. No more deployment orders. No more mothers crying themselves to sleep because their sons are in danger. No more fathers pacing the floor at 3 AM wondering if their child is safe.
That's not escapism. That's hope.
Captain Jenkins was right. Heaven isn't just a doctrine - it's a destination. And everything we're going through now, every tear, every fear, every sleepless night, it's all temporary.
The world is groaning. We're groaning. Creation itself is groaning, waiting for redemption. But the groaning has a purpose - it's labor pains. Something beautiful is being born.
I think I know what this series needs to be now. Not just about the darkness getting darker, but about the light that's coming. Not just about wars and tribulations, but about the peace that will end all wars.
Michael is learning about courage in a war zone. Maybe God is teaching me about hope in a broken world.
The title came to me during prayer: "When Hope Breaks Through: A Journey from Prophecy to Promise."
Four weeks. Start with the signs, but end with the Savior. Begin with the tribulation, but finish with the triumph.
Because my son needs to know - we all need to know - that this story has an ending. And it's beautiful.
"Even so, come, Lord Jesus."
But until then, keep my boy safe.
