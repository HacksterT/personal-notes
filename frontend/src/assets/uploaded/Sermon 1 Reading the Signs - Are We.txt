Sermon 1: "Reading the Signs - Are We Living in the Last Days?"
April 28, 2024
Opening Illustration:
Three weeks ago, I got a phone call that changed everything. "Your son's unit has received deployment orders for the Middle East." Just like that, my 22-year-old boy became part of the headlines we see every night. War isn't just something we watch on the news anymore - it's something that took my son.
That call sent me back to the Scriptures with new urgency. When Jesus' disciples asked, "What will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?" - I finally understood why they needed to know.
Text: Matthew 24:3-14
"Tell us," they said, "when will this happen, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?"
I. Jesus Warns Us to Watch (vs. 3-8)
A. Wars and Rumors of Wars (vs. 6-7)

Ukraine and Russia - over 2 years of devastating conflict
Middle East tensions escalating - where Michael serves today
China and Taiwan - superpowers positioning for conflict
Jesus said this would happen: "Nation will rise against nation"

B. Natural Disasters Increasing (vs. 7)

Turkey/Syria earthquake - 50,000+ dead in February 2023
Maui wildfires - entire town of Lahaina destroyed
Pakistan floods affecting 33 million people
"Like birth pains" - frequency and intensity increasing

C. Spiritual Deception Growing (vs. 11)

False teachers promising prosperity without Christ
New Age spirituality infiltrating churches
AI creating deepfakes - truth becoming harder to find
Even the elect could be deceived

II. Jesus Warns Us Not to Panic (vs. 6)
"See to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come."
A. These Signs Don't Mean Immediate End

Jesus warned against date-setting
Birth pains can last hours before delivery
Our job: faithful watching, not fearful calculating

B. God Is Still Sovereign Over Chaos

Every war is under His ultimate control
Every earthquake happens within His plan
Even Michael's deployment serves God's purposes

C. The Gospel Still Goes Forward (vs. 14)

Technology now enables global evangelism
Internet reaches closed countries
Persecution often spreads the gospel faster
This gospel of the kingdom will be preached to all nations

III. Jesus Calls Us to Readiness (vs. 13-14)
A. Endure to the End

Not salvation by works, but proof of salvation
Perseverance through trials shows genuine faith
Michael learning this lesson in ways I never could teach

B. Keep Preaching the Gospel

Urgency without panic
Love without compromise
Hope without naivety

Current Application:
For Families with Deployed Loved Ones:

Your fears are not faithless - they're human
God knows where your soldier is tonight
Their service may be part of God's end-times plan

For Everyone Watching the News:

Stop doom-scrolling and start Bible-reading
Current events should drive us to prayer, not despair
We're not looking for the undertaker - we're looking for the upper-taker

For the Church:

These are not the dark ages - these are the days of harvest
Every crisis is an evangelistic opportunity
The darker it gets, the brighter our light shines

Closing:
I don't know when Jesus is coming back. I don't know how long Michael will be deployed. But I know this: God is still writing history, and He hasn't forgotten His promises.
The signs are all around us. The birth pains are getting stronger. But remember - birth pains don't mean something's dying. They mean something beautiful is about to be born.
Are you ready? Not ready for tribulation - ready for transformation. Not ready for judgment - ready for Jesus.
"Therefore you also be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect." (Matthew 24:44)
