Sermon 2: "When Nations Rage - God's Prophetic Timeline Through Israel"
May 5, 2024
Opening:
Last week I showed you a map of where Michael is stationed. This week, I want to show you why that location matters to Bible prophecy. He's not just serving in the Middle East - he's serving at the epicenter of God's prophetic timeline.
For 1,878 years, there was no Israel. Then, on May 14, 1948, David Ben-Gurion read these words: "We hereby declare the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine, to be known as the State of Israel." A nation was reborn in a day, exactly as Isaiah prophesied.
Text: Ezekiel 37:21-22
"This is what the Sovereign Lord says: I will take the Israelites out of the nations where they have gone. I will gather them from all around and bring them back into their own land. I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel."
I. The Miracle of Israel's Restoration
A. A Fulfillment 2,000 Years in the Making

70 AD: Romans destroy Jerusalem, scatter Jews
1948: United Nations recognizes Israel
Hebrew language resurrected from the dead
Desert blooming exactly as Isaiah 35:1 predicted

B. Against Impossible Odds

Survived Hitler's attempt at genocide
Won independence war against 5 Arab armies
Six-Day War: took Jerusalem in historic fulfillment
Tiny nation surrounded by 400 million hostile neighbors

C. The Land Remembers Its People

Archaeological discoveries validating biblical history
Dead Sea Scrolls confirming biblical accuracy
Jerusalem's Western Wall reveals Temple foundations
Even the stones cry out the truth

II. The Current Prophetic Alignment
A. The Gog and Magog Coalition (Ezekiel 38)
Russia (Rosh/Gog) in Position:

Military bases in Syria, allied with Iran
Putin's invasion of Ukraine shows willingness for war
Ancient hatred of Jews surfacing again

Iran (Persia) Building Nuclear Capability:

"Death to Israel" chanted in government meetings
Proxy armies: Hamas, Hezbollah, Houthis
Ezekiel said Persia would be in the coalition

Turkey Turning from NATO toward Russia:

Erdogan's neo-Ottoman dreams
Hosting Hamas leaders after October 7
Ezekiel named "Gomer" and "Togarmah"

B. The Abraham Accords - Unexpected Peace

UAE, Bahrain, Morocco recognizing Israel
Saudi Arabia considering normalization
Ezekiel 38:11 - Israel dwelling safely when attacked
Peace agreements setting up prophetic scenario

C. Technology Enabling Global Control

Surveillance systems in every major city
Digital currencies preparing for mark of beast
Facial recognition tracking every movement
Revelation 13:17 - no buying or selling without mark

III. Jerusalem - The Burdensome Stone
A. Zechariah 12:2-3 Being Fulfilled Today

Jerusalem a "cup of trembling" for all nations
UN resolutions against Israel more than all other nations combined
October 7 Hamas attack brought global antisemitism into open
World becoming "drunk" with hatred for Jerusalem

B. The Temple Mount Tension

Third Temple preparations by Temple Institute
Red heifer breeding program completing
Archaeological evidence of Temple location
Daniel's 70th week requires rebuilt Temple

C. All Israel Will Be Saved (Romans 11:26)

During Great Tribulation, remnant will call on Messiah
"Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord"
National conversion when they see Jesus return
The hardening of Israel is partial and temporary

IV. What This Means for Us Today
A. God Keeps His Promises

If He keeps promises to Israel, He keeps promises to us
Every prophecy fulfilled increases our confidence
His faithfulness spans millennia

B. We're Living in Historic Times

First generation to see regathered Israel
First generation with technology for global mark system
First generation to see Gog coalition aligning
Biblical prophecy moving from prediction to fulfillment

C. Urgency for Gospel Ministry

Romans 11:25 - fullness of Gentiles coming in
Church age may be nearing completion
Every day of delay is mercy for more souls
Michael serving in region where Jesus will return

Personal Application:
Michael texted me yesterday: "Dad, I can see why this land is so important. You can feel the history here. It's like the whole Bible is spread out in front of you."
He's right. He's not just serving his country - he's serving at ground zero of God's prophetic timeline.
For all of us:

Study prophecy to understand the times
Support Israel while sharing gospel with Jewish people
Pray for peace of Jerusalem as commanded
Live with eternal perspective on current events

Closing:
The same God who scattered Israel in judgment is the God who regathered them in mercy. The same God who preserved them through 2,000 years of persecution is the God who preserves us through every trial.
The clock is ticking toward midnight. Israel is back in the land. The nations are aligning. Technology is ready. Hearts are hardening.
But don't be afraid. The same God who keeps His promises to Israel keeps His promises to you.
"Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: 'May those who love you be secure.'" (Psalm 122:6)
