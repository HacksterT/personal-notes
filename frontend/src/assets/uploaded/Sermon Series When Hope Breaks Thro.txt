Sermon Series: "When Hope Breaks Through: A Journey from Prophecy to Promise"

Sermon 1: "Reading the Signs - Are We Living in the Last Days?"
April 28, 2024
Opening Illustration:
Three weeks ago, I got a phone call that changed everything. "Your son's unit has received deployment orders for the Middle East." Just like that, my 22-year-old boy became part of the headlines we see every night. War isn't just something we watch on the news anymore - it's something that took my son.
That call sent me back to the Scriptures with new urgency. When Jesus' disciples asked, "What will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?" - I finally understood why they needed to know.
Text: Matthew 24:3-14
"Tell us," they said, "when will this happen, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?"
I. Jesus Warns Us to Watch (vs. 3-8)
A. Wars and Rumors of Wars (vs. 6-7)

Ukraine and Russia - over 2 years of devastating conflict
Middle East tensions escalating - where Michael serves today
China and Taiwan - superpowers positioning for conflict
Jesus said this would happen: "Nation will rise against nation"

B. Natural Disasters Increasing (vs. 7)

Turkey/Syria earthquake - 50,000+ dead in February 2023
Maui wildfires - entire town of Lahaina destroyed
Pakistan floods affecting 33 million people
"Like birth pains" - frequency and intensity increasing

C. Spiritual Deception Growing (vs. 11)

False teachers promising prosperity without Christ
New Age spirituality infiltrating churches
AI creating deepfakes - truth becoming harder to find
Even the elect could be deceived

II. Jesus Warns Us Not to Panic (vs. 6)
"See to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come."
A. These Signs Don't Mean Immediate End

Jesus warned against date-setting
Birth pains can last hours before delivery
Our job: faithful watching, not fearful calculating

B. God Is Still Sovereign Over Chaos

Every war is under His ultimate control
Every earthquake happens within His plan
Even Michael's deployment serves God's purposes

C. The Gospel Still Goes Forward (vs. 14)

Technology now enables global evangelism
Internet reaches closed countries
Persecution often spreads the gospel faster
This gospel of the kingdom will be preached to all nations

III. Jesus Calls Us to Readiness (vs. 13-14)
A. Endure to the End

Not salvation by works, but proof of salvation
Perseverance through trials shows genuine faith
Michael learning this lesson in ways I never could teach

B. Keep Preaching the Gospel

Urgency without panic
Love without compromise
Hope without naivety

Current Application:
For Families with Deployed Loved Ones:

Your fears are not faithless - they're human
God knows where your soldier is tonight
Their service may be part of God's end-times plan

For Everyone Watching the News:

Stop doom-scrolling and start Bible-reading
Current events should drive us to prayer, not despair
We're not looking for the undertaker - we're looking for the upper-taker

For the Church:

These are not the dark ages - these are the days of harvest
Every crisis is an evangelistic opportunity
The darker it gets, the brighter our light shines

Closing:
I don't know when Jesus is coming back. I don't know how long Michael will be deployed. But I know this: God is still writing history, and He hasn't forgotten His promises.
The signs are all around us. The birth pains are getting stronger. But remember - birth pains don't mean something's dying. They mean something beautiful is about to be born.
Are you ready? Not ready for tribulation - ready for transformation. Not ready for judgment - ready for Jesus.
"Therefore you also be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect." (Matthew 24:44)

Sermon 2: "When Nations Rage - God's Prophetic Timeline Through Israel"
May 5, 2024
Opening:
Last week I showed you a map of where Michael is stationed. This week, I want to show you why that location matters to Bible prophecy. He's not just serving in the Middle East - he's serving at the epicenter of God's prophetic timeline.
For 1,878 years, there was no Israel. Then, on May 14, 1948, David Ben-Gurion read these words: "We hereby declare the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine, to be known as the State of Israel." A nation was reborn in a day, exactly as Isaiah prophesied.
Text: Ezekiel 37:21-22
"This is what the Sovereign Lord says: I will take the Israelites out of the nations where they have gone. I will gather them from all around and bring them back into their own land. I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel."
I. The Miracle of Israel's Restoration
A. A Fulfillment 2,000 Years in the Making

70 AD: Romans destroy Jerusalem, scatter Jews
1948: United Nations recognizes Israel
Hebrew language resurrected from the dead
Desert blooming exactly as Isaiah 35:1 predicted

B. Against Impossible Odds

Survived Hitler's attempt at genocide
Won independence war against 5 Arab armies
Six-Day War: took Jerusalem in historic fulfillment
Tiny nation surrounded by 400 million hostile neighbors

C. The Land Remembers Its People

Archaeological discoveries validating biblical history
Dead Sea Scrolls confirming biblical accuracy
Jerusalem's Western Wall reveals Temple foundations
Even the stones cry out the truth

II. The Current Prophetic Alignment
A. The Gog and Magog Coalition (Ezekiel 38)
Russia (Rosh/Gog) in Position:

Military bases in Syria, allied with Iran
Putin's invasion of Ukraine shows willingness for war
Ancient hatred of Jews surfacing again

Iran (Persia) Building Nuclear Capability:

"Death to Israel" chanted in government meetings
Proxy armies: Hamas, Hezbollah, Houthis
Ezekiel said Persia would be in the coalition

Turkey Turning from NATO toward Russia:

Erdogan's neo-Ottoman dreams
Hosting Hamas leaders after October 7
Ezekiel named "Gomer" and "Togarmah"

B. The Abraham Accords - Unexpected Peace

UAE, Bahrain, Morocco recognizing Israel
Saudi Arabia considering normalization
Ezekiel 38:11 - Israel dwelling safely when attacked
Peace agreements setting up prophetic scenario

C. Technology Enabling Global Control

Surveillance systems in every major city
Digital currencies preparing for mark of beast
Facial recognition tracking every movement
Revelation 13:17 - no buying or selling without mark

III. Jerusalem - The Burdensome Stone
A. Zechariah 12:2-3 Being Fulfilled Today

Jerusalem a "cup of trembling" for all nations
UN resolutions against Israel more than all other nations combined
October 7 Hamas attack brought global antisemitism into open
World becoming "drunk" with hatred for Jerusalem

B. The Temple Mount Tension

Third Temple preparations by Temple Institute
Red heifer breeding program completing
Archaeological evidence of Temple location
Daniel's 70th week requires rebuilt Temple

C. All Israel Will Be Saved (Romans 11:26)

During Great Tribulation, remnant will call on Messiah
"Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord"
National conversion when they see Jesus return
The hardening of Israel is partial and temporary

IV. What This Means for Us Today
A. God Keeps His Promises

If He keeps promises to Israel, He keeps promises to us
Every prophecy fulfilled increases our confidence
His faithfulness spans millennia

B. We're Living in Historic Times

First generation to see regathered Israel
First generation with technology for global mark system
First generation to see Gog coalition aligning
Biblical prophecy moving from prediction to fulfillment

C. Urgency for Gospel Ministry

Romans 11:25 - fullness of Gentiles coming in
Church age may be nearing completion
Every day of delay is mercy for more souls
Michael serving in region where Jesus will return

Personal Application:
Michael texted me yesterday: "Dad, I can see why this land is so important. You can feel the history here. It's like the whole Bible is spread out in front of you."
He's right. He's not just serving his country - he's serving at ground zero of God's prophetic timeline.
For all of us:

Study prophecy to understand the times
Support Israel while sharing gospel with Jewish people
Pray for peace of Jerusalem as commanded
Live with eternal perspective on current events

Closing:
The same God who scattered Israel in judgment is the God who regathered them in mercy. The same God who preserved them through 2,000 years of persecution is the God who preserves us through every trial.
The clock is ticking toward midnight. Israel is back in the land. The nations are aligning. Technology is ready. Hearts are hardening.
But don't be afraid. The same God who keeps His promises to Israel keeps His promises to you.
"Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: 'May those who love you be secure.'" (Psalm 122:6)

Sermon 3: "When Truth Becomes Lies - Navigating the Great Deception"
May 12, 2024
Opening Illustration:
Michael called last week with a troubling question: "Dad, how do I know what's really happening here? The reports I'm reading back home don't match what I'm seeing on the ground. Who's telling the truth?"
I had to admit - I don't know either. We're living in an age where truth itself is under attack. Deepfake videos make lies look real. Social media algorithms create echo chambers. Everyone claims to have "the real truth."
Jesus warned this would happen. He said deception would be so convincing that even God's people would struggle to tell truth from lies.
Text: 2 Thessalonians 2:9-12
"The coming of the lawless one will be in accordance with how Satan works. He will use all sorts of false miracles, signs and wonders to deceive those who are perishing. They perish because they refused to love the truth and so be saved. For this reason God sends them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie."
I. The Great Deception Is Already Here
A. Technology Making Lies Look Like Truth

Deepfake videos of world leaders saying things they never said
AI-generated images that fool professional photographers
Voice cloning technology replicating anyone's speech
Revelation 13:15 - "speaking image" may be AI-powered

B. Information Warfare in Real Time

Ukraine war: Both sides claiming victory
COVID-19: Conflicting "expert" opinions
Michael experiencing propaganda firsthand
Truth becomes whatever supports your side

C. Religious Deception Increasing

Prosperity preachers promising health and wealth
Progressive Christianity denying biblical authority
New Age spirituality infiltrating evangelical churches
False unity movements compromising gospel truth

II. The Coming Super-Deception
A. The Lawless One (vs. 9)

Antichrist will perform genuine supernatural signs
Not just parlor tricks - actual miracles through Satan's power
Will claim to be divine, demanding worship
Even true believers will be severely tested

B. The Strong Delusion (vs. 11)

God will remove restraint on deception
People will choose lies over readily available truth
Not God deceiving them - God allowing consequences
Similar to Romans 1:18-32 - judicial hardening

C. Signs We're Approaching This Time

Truth itself becoming "hate speech"
Scientific dissent being censored
Historical facts being rewritten
Biological reality being denied

III. Why People Believe Lies
A. They Refuse to Love the Truth (vs. 10)

Not just rejecting truth - refusing to love it
Truth requires humility and change
Lies often tell us what we want to hear
Easier to believe comfortable lies than difficult truths

B. They Want Their Ears Tickled (2 Timothy 4:3)

Accumulating teachers who say what they want to hear
Shopping for pastors who won't challenge sin
Preferring motivational speeches over biblical sermons
Comfort over conviction

C. They Love Darkness Rather than Light (John 3:19)

Light exposes sin and requires response
Darkness allows continuing in rebellion
Moral relativism: "your truth" vs. "my truth"
Denying absolute truth allows moral compromise

IV. How to Stay Anchored in Truth
A. Know the Word (2 Timothy 3:16-17)

All Scripture is God-breathed and profitable
Bible is our standard for truth
Regular Bible reading builds discernment
If it contradicts Scripture, it's false

B. Test Everything (1 Thessalonians 5:21)

"Test all things; hold fast what is good"
Don't believe something just because it's repeated often
Check sources and motivations
Ask: Does this align with biblical truth?

C. Pray for Discernment (1 Kings 3:9)

Solomon asked for discerning heart
Holy Spirit guides into all truth
Spiritual discernment required for spiritual deception
Prayer protects from intellectual pride

D. Stay in Biblical Community (Hebrews 10:25)

Iron sharpens iron
Multiple perspectives prevent deception
Accountability in biblical interpretation
Don't isolate yourself with only confirming sources

V. Practical Guidelines for Our Time
A. Limit News Consumption

Set specific times for news updates
Avoid 24/7 news cycles that create anxiety
Remember: Most news is opinion, not fact
Spend more time in Bible than news

B. Diversify Information Sources

Don't get all news from one perspective
Read primary sources, not just commentary
International perspectives on American events
Historical context helps evaluate current claims

C. Focus on What You Can Control

You can't fix media bias
You can love your neighbor
You can share the gospel
You can live righteously regardless of cultural lies

Personal Application:
For Michael and All Our Military:

Trust your training and your commanders
Remember your ultimate allegiance is to Christ
Don't let conflicting reports destroy your faith
Focus on your mission, not media spin

For Families Watching the News:

Turn off the fear machine occasionally
Discuss current events through biblical lens
Teach children to think critically
Model calm confidence in God's sovereignty

For the Church:

Preach the Word, not political opinions
Address cultural lies with biblical truth
Create safe spaces for honest questions
Don't become known more for what we're against than what we're for

Closing:
Jesus said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life." In a world of deception, He remains our anchor. In an age of lies, His Word stands forever.
Michael asked me how to know what's really happening in his war zone. I told him: "Son, focus on the truth you can know for certain. God loves you. Jesus died for you. The Holy Spirit guides you. Everything else is just details."
The great deception is coming. It may already be here. But we don't have to be deceived. We have the Truth Himself living in our hearts.
"Sanctify them by Your truth. Your word is truth." (John 17:17)
When everything else seems uncertain, stand on the Word. It never changes. It never lies. It never fails.

Sermon 4: "Not Our Stopping Point, But Our Starting Point - The Hope of Heaven"
May 19, 2024
Opening:
Four weeks ago, I stood in this pulpit with my heart breaking, trying to make sense of a world that seemed to be falling apart. My son was deploying to a war zone. The news was full of violence and hatred. I had more questions than answers.
Today, I stand here with the same circumstances but a completely different perspective. Michael is still deployed. The world is still broken. But I've remembered something that changes everything: This world is not our stopping point - it's our starting point.
Captain Jenkins, a chaplain serving with Michael, lost his father in Afghanistan fifteen years ago. Michael told me, "Dad, he talks about heaven differently than you do. Like it's real. Like it's home."
That hit me hard. How do I talk about heaven? Like a theological concept? Like a distant comfort? Or like the place where this broken world finally gets fixed?
Text: Revelation 21:1-5
"Then I saw 'a new heaven and a new earth,' for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea. I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband."
I. This World Is Temporary - The New World Is Eternal
A. The Old Order Is Passing Away (vs. 1)

Current heaven and earth are not permanent
"Passed away" - Greek word "parerchomai" - to go by, to pass away
All the pain, all the wars, all the separation - temporary
What feels so permanent to us is just a brief chapter

B. No More Sea (vs. 1)

In John's time, sea represented separation and chaos
Revelation 13 - beast rising from the sea
No more barriers between peoples
No more chaos, no more unpredictable storms
Michael won't need to cross oceans to come home

C. Everything Made New (vs. 5)

Not remodeled - completely new
Not reformed - totally transformed
This isn't heaven patching up earth's problems
This is God creating something better than Eden

II. Heaven Comes to Earth - We Don't Just Go to Heaven
A. The New Jerusalem Comes Down (vs. 2)

Heaven doesn't stay "up there"
God brings His dwelling place to us
Marriage imagery - intimate, permanent union
We don't escape earth - we inherit the new earth

B. God Will Dwell With Us (vs. 3)

"Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men"
Not visiting us - moving in permanently
No more separation between heaven and earth
No more "God seems distant" feelings

C. We Will Be His People (vs. 3)

Relationship, not just location
Family, not just subjects
Intimate knowledge, not just acquaintance
The relationship Adam lost, we gain forever

III. All Tears Wiped Away - Every Sorrow Healed
A. Personal Pain Ended (vs. 4)

Death - No more deployment notifications, no more funerals
Mourning - No more missing loved ones, no more grief
Crying - Every tear I've cried over Michael, wiped away
Pain - Physical, emotional, spiritual - all gone forever

B. Systemic Evil Destroyed

No more war departments, only peace departments
No more hospitals, only health
No more prisons, only righteousness
No more weapons, only tools of life

C. The Former Things Pass Away

PTSD from war - gone
Anxiety about loved ones - gone
Fear of the future - gone
All the things that keep us awake at 3 AM - gone forever

IV. What This Means for How We Live Today
A. Present Suffering Has Purpose (Romans 8:18)

Current sufferings not worthy to compare with coming glory
Pain has meaning when you know the destination
Michael's deployment is part of larger story
Birth pains, not meaningless agony

B. Death Is Not the End

For believers, death is graduation day
2 Corinthians 5:8 - absent from body, present with Lord
We don't lose loved ones, we go to meet them
Captain Jenkins will see his father again

C. Investment Strategy Changes

Matthew 6:19-21 - store treasures in heaven
Only two things are eternal: God's Word and people's souls
Everything else is temporary project material
Focus on relationships that outlast this world

V. Practical Heaven Living
A. How to Comfort Others

Share hope, not just sympathy
Remind them this isn't the end of the story
Help them see beyond the grave
Point to reunion, not just loss

B. How to Face Our Own Trials

Light and momentary compared to eternal weight of glory
This too shall pass - literally
God is preparing us for something better
Present circumstances don't define future destiny

C. How to Evangelize with Hope

Don't just save from hell, save for heaven
Help people see what they're invited to
Heaven isn't boring - it's everything we've always wanted
Relationship with God in perfect world

Personal Testimony:
Three weeks ago, I was afraid for Michael's safety. Today, I'm excited for Michael's future. Not because his circumstances changed, but because my perspective changed.
Whether Michael comes home safely from this deployment or whether he goes home to heaven, he's going home. This broken world was never meant to be our permanent address.
Bob Henderson told me, "You learn to pray differently when you remember that this isn't their real home." He's right. I'm not just praying for Michael's protection in a war zone. I'm praying for Michael's preparation for a kingdom.
What Heaven Will Be Like:
A. Reunion Without Fear of Separation

All believers throughout history together
No more goodbyes, only hellos
Fellowship without misunderstanding
Love without fear of loss

B. Purpose Without Frustration

Serving God without sin to hinder us
Work without futility or failure
Creativity without limitation
Learning without forgetting

C. Rest Without Boredom

Peace without laziness
Satisfaction without emptiness
Joy without ending
Worship without weariness

Closing Challenge:
If you knew you were moving to a new city next month, you'd start living differently today. You'd pack differently. You'd invest differently. You'd say goodbye differently.
We are moving. Maybe sooner than we think. Jesus is preparing a place for us. The new heaven and new earth are coming. This world is not our stopping point - it's our starting point.
For Michael and all our deployed military: You're not just defending a country - you're serving a King whose kingdom will never end.
For everyone facing loss and pain: This is not how the story ends. The best chapters haven't been written yet.
For anyone who hasn't trusted Christ: This invitation to the new heaven and new earth is for you. Don't miss the greatest moving day in history.
Captain Jenkins was right. Heaven isn't just where we go when we die - it's where everything wrong gets made right. It's where every tear gets wiped away. It's where every war ends in permanent peace.
"He who was seated on the throne said, 'I am making everything new!'" (Revelation 21:5)
This world is not our home. We're just passing through. But the place we're going - it's better than we can imagine.
And that changes how we live today.
Even so, come, Lord Jesus. But until then, we watch, we work, we worship, and we wait with hope.
Series Conclusion:
Four weeks ago, I began this series wrestling with fear. I end it resting in hope. The signs of the times haven't changed. The prophetic timeline hasn't slowed down. The world is still broken.
But I remember now - this brokenness has an expiration date. This pain has a purpose. This separation is temporary.
We're not watching the world end. We're watching the new world begin.
"Even so, come, Lord Jesus."
