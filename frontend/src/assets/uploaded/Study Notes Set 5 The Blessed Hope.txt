The Return of Christ:
Two-Stage Return?

Rapture: For His saints (1 Thess 4:16-17)
Second Coming: With His saints (Rev 19:11-16)
7-year gap for tribulation?

Signs of His Coming:

Israel regathered ✓
Gospel preached to all nations (technology enables)
Apostasy in churches ✓

The Millennial Kingdom (Revelation 20):
Christ's 1000-Year Reign

Satan bound, peace on earth
Justice and righteousness established
Israel restored to prominence
Nations learning war no more (Isaiah 2:4)

What Michael Will See:

No more deployments or wars
Swords beaten into plowshares
Wolf dwelling with lamb
Knowledge of Lord covering earth

The New Heaven and New Earth (Revelation 21-22):
No More Curse

No more death, sorrow, crying, pain (Rev 21:4)
No more war or violence
No more separation from loved ones
No more fear for our children's safety

The New Jerusalem

1,400-mile cube city
Streets of gold, gates of pearl
River of life, tree of life
God's presence immediately accessible

Eternal Activities

Worship without weariness
Service without frustration
Learning without limitations
Relationships without barriers

Present Implications:
How This Changes Everything:

Perspective on Suffering: Light and momentary (2 Cor 4:17)
Motivation for Holiness: We'll see Him as He is (1 John 3:2)
Urgency for Evangelism: Limited time to reach lost
Comfort in Grief: Death is not final

Practical Hope:

Michael's deployments are temporary
Every tear I've cried will be wiped away
Every prayer for protection has eternal significance
This broken world is not our final home

Personal Testimony Moments:
Captain Jenkins' Words to Michael:
"Heaven isn't just where we go when we die - it's where everything wrong gets made right."
Bob Henderson's Perspective:
"When you've got eternity in view, deployment seasons look different."
My Own Journey:
From fear and questioning to hope and anticipation
From "Why is this happening?" to "What is this preparing us for?"
Sermon Series Culmination:
Title: "What We Have to Look Forward To"
Three Movements:

The Reunion - Seeing Jesus face to face
The Restoration - All things made new
The Reign - Serving in His eternal kingdom

Key Applications:

Live with eternal perspective
Invest in relationships that matter forever
Don't lose heart in temporary troubles
Share the hope we have in Christ

Closing Challenge:
"If you knew Jesus was returning next week, what would you do differently today?"
Personal Reflection:
This series has taken me from journal entries full of fear to study notes full of hope. The same events that looked like meaningless suffering now look like birth pains of something beautiful.
Michael is serving in a region where biblical prophecy unfolds, but he's also serving a King whose kingdom will never end. That changes everything.
"Even so, come, Lord Jesus." (Revelation 22:20)
But until then, we watch, we work, we worship, and we wait with hope.
