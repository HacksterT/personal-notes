Finding God in Dark Seasons
Finding God in Dark Seasons
A Study from Psalm 23:4 and Job 23:8-10

Introduction

Six months ago, if someone had told me I'd be preaching about finding God in darkness, I might have offered neat theological answers about God's sovereignty and the problem of suffering. But life has a way of making theology personal.

Recent months have brought our church family through valleys we never expected to walk. We've said goodbye to beloved members, watched families struggle with unemployment, and faced health crises that shook our faith to its core. Perhaps you've found yourself asking, "Where is God when life falls apart?"

Today, we explore what it means to find God not in spite of our dark seasons, but within them.

Main Points

1. God Walks With Us in the Valley (Psalm 23:4)
"Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me."

Notice David doesn't say "if" I walk through the valley, but "though" - acknowledging that dark seasons are part of life's journey. Yet the promise isn't that we'll avoid the valley, but that we'll never walk through it alone.

The Hebrew word for "with" (immad) implies not just presence, but active companionship. God doesn't watch our suffering from a distance; He enters into it with us. This is the God who became flesh, who wept at Lazarus's tomb, who cried out "My God, why have you forsaken me?" from the cross.

2. God May Be Present Even When Hidden (Job 23:8-10)
Job's honest confession resonates with anyone who has felt God's absence: "But if I go to the east, he is not there; if I go to the west, I do not find him."

Yet Job follows this with remarkable faith: "But he knows the way that I take; when he has tested me, I will come forth as gold."

Sometimes God's apparent absence is actually His hidden presence. Like a surgeon who must cause pain to bring healing, God may work in ways that feel like abandonment but are actually acts of love. The testing isn't punishment - it's refinement.

3. Darkness Can Deepen Our Faith (Various Scriptures)
Paradoxically, many believers discover their deepest faith not in mountain-top experiences, but in valley seasons. Why?

- Desperation drives us to prayer in ways comfort never could
- Stripped of other securities, we learn to trust God alone  
- Suffering teaches empathy that enables authentic ministry to others
- Dark seasons reveal the insufficiency of shallow faith and drive us toward genuine dependence on Christ

Consider the testimonies of saints throughout history: John of the Cross wrote about "the dark night of the soul," Charles Spurgeon battled depression while experiencing God's presence, and countless believers have found that their darkest hours became the birthplace of their strongest faith.

Application

If you're in a dark season today:

1. Name the Darkness
Don't spiritualize your pain or pretend it's not real. God can handle your honest questions and raw emotions. The Psalms are full of complaint, confusion, and even anger directed toward God.

2. Look for God's Presence in Unexpected Places
- In the friend who shows up without being asked
- In unexpected provision during financial hardship  
- In peace that makes no sense given your circumstances
- In strength to face another day when you thought you couldn't

3. Hold onto What You Know
When feelings fail, anchor yourself in truth:
- God's character doesn't change based on your circumstances
- His love isn't conditional on your ability to feel it
- His promises remain even when everything else shakes

Personal Journey

My own dark season began with my mother's cancer diagnosis, deepened through watching her suffering, and culminated in questions I'd never dared ask before. For months, prayers felt like they hit the ceiling. Scripture seemed like empty words.

But gradually, I began to notice God's presence in new ways:
- In the nurse who took extra time to explain treatment options
- In friends who brought meals without being asked
- In my mother's surprising peace in the midst of pain
- In a deeper understanding of Christ's suffering that no theology textbook could have taught

The darkness didn't lift quickly, but God's presence became more real, not less.

Practical Steps for Dark Seasons

1. Establish Non-Negotiable Rhythms
When emotions are unreliable, let discipline carry your faith:
- Daily time in Scripture, even if it feels dry
- Regular prayer, even if it feels one-sided  
- Consistent fellowship, even when you don't feel like it

2. Journal Your Journey
Write down:
- Honest prayers and questions
- Small evidences of God's care
- Lessons learned in the darkness
- How your understanding of God is changing

3. Serve Others in Similar Valleys
Nothing transforms our pain like using it to help others. Your current struggle may be preparation for future ministry you can't yet imagine.

Conclusion

Dark seasons are not signs of God's abandonment - they're invitations to know Him in deeper ways. The God who created light from darkness, who brought life from death, who turns mourning into dancing, is the same God who walks with you through your valley.

Your dark season has an expiration date. Until then, you don't walk alone.

Trust the process. God is working, even when you can't see it.

Prayer

Father, in seasons when we cannot trace Your hand, help us trust Your heart. When darkness surrounds us, remind us that You are light. When we feel abandoned, assure us of Your presence. Use even our dark seasons to draw us closer to You and prepare us to comfort others with the comfort we receive from You. In Jesus' name, Amen.
