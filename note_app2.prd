### Phase 3: LLM-Compatible Preprocessing & Trimming Strategy

**Objective**: Implement intelligent content preprocessing to optimize long-form notes for AI analysis while preserving meaning, structure, and readability.

**Goal**: Prepare long-form note text for submission to large language models (e.g., Grok) by reducing token count without compromising legibility, meaning, or structure.

#### 3.1 Guiding Principles and Architecture Design
- [ ] **3.1.1** Define preprocessing service architecture:
  - Create `content_preprocessor.py` service for text optimization
  - Integrate with existing `analysis_service.py` workflow
  - Maintain backward compatibility with current content processing
- [ ] **3.1.2** Establish core preprocessing principles:
  - ‚úÖ **Preserve sentence structure**: LLMs trained on full natural language; avoid over-cleaning
  - ‚úÖ **Prioritize content**: Remove fluff/repeated phrases, not informative sentences  
  - ‚úÖ **Trim intelligently**: Use sentence-level filtering instead of hard truncation
  - ‚úÖ **Stay under token limits**: Estimate input size with margin for response tokens

#### 3.2 Step 1: Light Normalization Implementation
- [ ] **3.2.1** Implement structure-preserving normalization:
  - Optional lowercase conversion (LLMs are case-aware but not case-sensitive)
  - Remove non-linguistic noise (extra spaces, decorative symbols, emojis unless meaningful)
  - Strip metadata noise (timestamps, author headers, page numbers)
- [ ] **3.2.2** Preserve grammar and readability:
  - Maintain sentence boundaries and punctuation
  - Keep paragraph structure intact
  - Avoid breaking mid-thought or fragmenting sentences

#### 3.3 Step 2: Sentence Segmentation System
- [ ] **3.3.1** Implement sentence boundary detection:
  - Use punctuation-based splitting for simple cases
  - Consider integrating NLP tools (spaCy) for complex sentence structures
  - Handle edge cases (abbreviations, decimal numbers, quotes)
- [ ] **3.3.2** Create paragraph and sentence indexing:
  - Maintain original sentence order and context
  - Enable selective trimming without cutting mid-thought
  - Preserve logical flow and transitions between ideas

#### 3.4 Step 3: Relevance Scoring and Filtering
- [ ] **3.4.1** **Option A: Keyword Density Approach**:
  - Score sentences based on frequency of meaningful words (nouns, verbs)
  - Identify domain-specific terminology for theological content
  - Weight sentences with higher information density
- [ ] **3.4.2** **Option B: Heuristic-Based Filtering**:
  - Prioritize sentences with personal reflections ("I realized", "This helped me...")
  - Identify questions, conclusions, and summary statements  
  - Weight paragraphs near end of notes (often contain summaries)
- [ ] **3.4.3** **Option C: Lightweight Extractive Summarization**:
  - Implement TF-IDF scoring for sentence importance
  - Consider integration with summarization libraries (sumy)
  - Extract top 5-10 key sentences based on content relevance
- [ ] **3.4.4** Choose and implement optimal filtering strategy:
  - Test multiple approaches with sample content
  - Measure effectiveness on theological analysis quality
  - Implement configurable strategy selection

#### 3.5 Step 4: Reassembly and Quality Assurance
- [ ] **3.5.1** Implement intelligent content reassembly:
  - Reorder filtered sentences to maintain logical flow (intro ‚Üí body ‚Üí conclusion)
  - Ensure trimmed text reads smoothly and coherently
  - Avoid "floating" sentences without proper context
- [ ] **3.5.2** Quality validation system:
  - Verify sentence completeness and grammatical correctness
  - Check for maintained narrative flow and coherence
  - Ensure key theological concepts are preserved

#### 3.6 Integration with Existing AI Workflow
- [ ] **3.6.1** Integrate preprocessor with analysis service:
  - Modify `analysis_service.py` to use preprocessing before AI analysis
  - Add configuration options for preprocessing intensity levels
  - Maintain fallback to original content if preprocessing fails
- [ ] **3.6.2** Token limit management:
  - Implement token estimation for Grok and Claude APIs
  - Add configurable limits based on AI service and operation type
  - Reserve token space for AI response generation
- [ ] **3.6.3** Performance optimization:
  - Cache preprocessed content to avoid reprocessing
  - Implement async processing for large content items
  - Add processing time tracking and optimization metrics

#### 3.7 Testing and Validation
- [ ] **3.7.1** Test preprocessing effectiveness:
  - Compare AI analysis quality: original vs preprocessed content
  - Measure token reduction percentages while maintaining meaning
  - Test with various content types (sermons, study notes, journals)
- [ ] **3.7.2** Performance and reliability testing:
  - Test processing speed with large content items
  - Validate error handling and fallback mechanisms
  - Ensure preprocessing doesn't break existing workflows
- [ ] **3.7.3** User experience validation:
  - Test upload and save workflows with preprocessing enabled
  - Verify AI analysis results maintain quality and relevance
  - Collect performance metrics for optimization

  - **Workflow 2 Fix**: LibraryStacks "Load Active Resources" icon includes tags in localStorage data
  - **Clean Interface**: No "Tags:" label - color scheme provides visual identification

**Key Technical Implementation Notes:**
- **localStorage Custom Tags**: `/frontend/src/constants/tagConstants.js` - custom array empty, managed via localStorage
- **TagSettings localStorage Pattern**: 
  ```javascript
  const loadCustomTags = () => JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('customTags') || '[]');
  const saveCustomTags = (tags) => localStorage.setItem('customTags', JSON.stringify(tags));
  ```
- **TagBoxes localStorage Integration**: Custom tags loaded via `localStorage.getItem('customTags')` in `getAvailableTagsForCategory()`
- **Critical Storage Service Fix**: `/backend/services/storage_service.py` - `store_content()` uses dynamic SQL for partial updates to prevent content overwrites
- **StudyHall Tag State Management**: `currentTags` state synchronized with content loading, saving, and API calls
- **Resource Data Enrichment Pattern**: Both `loadActiveResourcesFromStorage()` and `handleResourceSelect()` fetch complete data via `apiService.getContent()` to include tags
- **LibraryStacks Resource Format**: `resourceItem` structure in "Load Active Resources" workflow must include `tags: item.tags || []`
- **TagBoxes Conditional Editing**: `onTagsChange={editingContentId ? handleTagsChange : undefined}` - only editable when content has valid ID

### Future Enhancements and Optimizations

#### Container Architecture Improvements
Based on current Docker build approach, consider these optimizations:

**Multi-Stage Build Optimization**:
- **Layer caching**: Optimize Dockerfile layer ordering for faster rebuilds
- **Build context**: Use .dockerignore more aggressively to reduce build context size
- **Dependency caching**: Separate dependency installation from code changes

**Runtime Improvements**:
- **Health checks**: Add comprehensive health check endpoints for both app and database
- **Graceful shutdown**: Implement proper signal handling for container restarts
- **Resource limits**: Add memory and CPU limits to compose.yaml for resource management

**File Storage Enhancements**:
- **Hybrid storage**: Runtime regeneration + caching for frequently changing content
- **Compression**: Compress text files in build to reduce image size
- **Selective inclusion**: Only include essential files in image, generate others at runtime

**Development Workflow**:
- **Hot reload**: Development-specific volume mounts for faster iteration
- **Multi-environment**: Separate compose files for development vs production
- **Automated testing**: Container-based test suites for CI/CD

#### Existing Planned Enhancements
- NAS backup integration  
- Additional security hardening
- Performance optimizations

#### Bible Reference System Enhancements
Based on analysis of current auto-extraction system that stores multiple references but only displays first:

**Current System Behavior**:
- Auto-extracts ALL Bible references from uploaded content using regex patterns
- Stores first reference in `passage` field (displayed in UI)
- Stores complete list in `metadata.bible_references` array (hidden)
- Example: "John 3:16, Romans 8:28, Phil 4:13" ‚Üí UI shows "John 3:16", metadata contains all three

**Future Enhancement Opportunities**:
- **Multiple Reference Display**: Show count indicator like "John 3:16 (+2 more)" in list/card views
- **Reference Selection UI**: Allow users to select which reference becomes the primary display
- **Enhanced Semantic Search**: Leverage complete `bible_references` array for verse-based content discovery
- **Reference Accuracy**: Improve regex patterns for complex citations (chapter ranges, cross-references)
- **Reference Validation**: Cross-reference against Bible database for accuracy and standardization
- **Visual Reference Browser**: Modal/expandable view showing all detected references with context
- **Smart Primary Selection**: Logic to identify most important reference (frequency, position, theological weight)

## Technical Requirements

### Local PC Requirements
- Docker Engine 20.10+
- 4GB RAM minimum (2GB for app, 2GB for PostgreSQL)
- 10GB storage minimum
- Network access to NAS for backups

### NAS Integration
- SMB/NFS mount for PostgreSQL data directory
- Automated backup scripts
- Version retention policy
- Recovery procedures documentation

### Security Considerations
- Localhost-only access by default
- Strong database passwords
- Regular security updates
- Data encryption for sensitive notes

## Conclusion

The **Single Container + External PostgreSQL** approach is recommended as it provides the best balance of simplicity, reliability, and future cloud deployment compatibility. The existing Dockerfile already supports this architecture, requiring minimal changes to implement a personal note management system while preserving the ability to deploy the full sermon organizer to the cloud.

This approach ensures that both the personal note manager and the cloud-deployed sermon organizer can share the same codebase with appropriate configuration differences, maintaining development efficiency while serving distinct purposes.
