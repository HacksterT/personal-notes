**Completed**: Phases 1, 2, and most of Phase 4 (comprehensive tag management system)
**In Progress**: Phase 3 (LLM-compatible preprocessing strategy)

---

### Phase 3: LLM-Compatible Preprocessing & Trimming Strategy

**Objective**: Implement intelligent content preprocessing to optimize long-form notes for AI analysis while preserving meaning, structure, and readability.

**Goal**: Prepare long-form note text for submission to large language models (e.g., Grok) by reducing token count without compromising legibility, meaning, or structure.

#### 3.1 Guiding Principles and Architecture Design
- [ ] **3.1.1** Define preprocessing service architecture:
  - Create `content_preprocessor.py` service for text optimization
  - Integrate with existing `analysis_service.py` workflow
  - Maintain backward compatibility with current content processing
- [ ] **3.1.2** Establish core preprocessing principles:
  - ✅ **Preserve sentence structure**: LLMs trained on full natural language; avoid over-cleaning
  - ✅ **Prioritize content**: Remove fluff/repeated phrases, not informative sentences  
  - ✅ **Trim intelligently**: Use sentence-level filtering instead of hard truncation
  - ✅ **Stay under token limits**: Estimate input size with margin for response tokens

#### 3.2 Step 1: Light Normalization Implementation
- [ ] **3.2.1** Implement structure-preserving normalization:
  - Optional lowercase conversion (LLMs are case-aware but not case-sensitive)
  - Remove non-linguistic noise (extra spaces, decorative symbols, emojis unless meaningful)
  - Strip metadata noise (timestamps, author headers, page numbers)
- [ ] **3.2.2** Preserve grammar and readability:
  - Maintain sentence boundaries and punctuation
  - Keep paragraph structure intact
  - Avoid breaking mid-thought or fragmenting sentences

#### 3.3 Step 2: Sentence Segmentation System
- [ ] **3.3.1** Implement sentence boundary detection:
  - Use punctuation-based splitting for simple cases
  - Consider integrating NLP tools (spaCy) for complex sentence structures
  - Handle edge cases (abbreviations, decimal numbers, quotes)
- [ ] **3.3.2** Create paragraph and sentence indexing:
  - Maintain original sentence order and context
  - Enable selective trimming without cutting mid-thought
  - Preserve logical flow and transitions between ideas

#### 3.4 Step 3: Relevance Scoring and Filtering
- [ ] **3.4.1** **Option A: Keyword Density Approach**:
  - Score sentences based on frequency of meaningful words (nouns, verbs)
  - Identify domain-specific terminology for theological content
  - Weight sentences with higher information density
- [ ] **3.4.2** **Option B: Heuristic-Based Filtering**:
  - Prioritize sentences with personal reflections ("I realized", "This helped me...")
  - Identify questions, conclusions, and summary statements  
  - Weight paragraphs near end of notes (often contain summaries)
- [ ] **3.4.3** **Option C: Lightweight Extractive Summarization**:
  - Implement TF-IDF scoring for sentence importance
  - Consider integration with summarization libraries (sumy)
  - Extract top 5-10 key sentences based on content relevance
- [ ] **3.4.4** Choose and implement optimal filtering strategy:
  - Test multiple approaches with sample content
  - Measure effectiveness on theological analysis quality
  - Implement configurable strategy selection

#### 3.5 Step 4: Reassembly and Quality Assurance
- [ ] **3.5.1** Implement intelligent content reassembly:
  - Reorder filtered sentences to maintain logical flow (intro → body → conclusion)
  - Ensure trimmed text reads smoothly and coherently
  - Avoid "floating" sentences without proper context
- [ ] **3.5.2** Quality validation system:
  - Verify sentence completeness and grammatical correctness
  - Check for maintained narrative flow and coherence
  - Ensure key theological concepts are preserved

#### 3.6 Integration with Existing AI Workflow
- [ ] **3.6.1** Integrate preprocessor with analysis service:
  - Modify `analysis_service.py` to use preprocessing before AI analysis
  - Add configuration options for preprocessing intensity levels
  - Maintain fallback to original content if preprocessing fails
- [ ] **3.6.2** Token limit management:
  - Implement token estimation for Grok and Claude APIs
  - Add configurable limits based on AI service and operation type
  - Reserve token space for AI response generation
- [ ] **3.6.3** Performance optimization:
  - Cache preprocessed content to avoid reprocessing
  - Implement async processing for large content items
  - Add processing time tracking and optimization metrics

#### 3.7 Testing and Validation
- [ ] **3.7.1** Test preprocessing effectiveness:
  - Compare AI analysis quality: original vs preprocessed content
  - Measure token reduction percentages while maintaining meaning
  - Test with various content types (sermons, study notes, journals)
- [ ] **3.7.2** Performance and reliability testing:
  - Test processing speed with large content items
  - Validate error handling and fallback mechanisms
  - Ensure preprocessing doesn't break existing workflows
- [ ] **3.7.3** User experience validation:
  - Test upload and save workflows with preprocessing enabled
  - Verify AI analysis results maintain quality and relevance
  - Collect performance metrics for optimization

### Phase 4: Comprehensive Tag Management System

  - **Tier 1**: Category selection dropdown (Green/Blue/Orange/Purple) when clicking empty slot
  - **Tier 2**: Tag selection dropdown filtered by chosen category
  - **Tag Sources**: 
    - Prescriptive tags from TagSettings constants
    - Custom tags from TagSettings Purple category
    - "Create New Custom Tag" option (Purple category only)
  - **Auto-close**: Selection automatically closes dropdown and assigns tag

- [x] **4.2.3** Tag slot management and validation:
  - **Category Limits**: Enforce 2 tags max for Green/Blue/Orange, 1 tag max for Purple
  - **Tag Removal**: Click tag to show remove button (X icon)
  - **Tag Replacement**: Click filled slot to change tag (opens category-filtered dropdown)
  - **Save Tags Button**: Appears when any tag changes are made, single API call for all edits
  - **Batch Updates**: Overwrite entire 5-tag array with current selections

  - **Dual Workflows**: New notes start with blank tags, imported notes load with existing tags
  - **Save Integration**: Tags persist with content for both new document creation and existing document updates
  - **API Integration**: Uses same `updateContentTags` API as library cards with proper error handling
  - **Compact Display**: Tags display in compact mode to fit banner layout without "Tags:" label

- [x] **4.3.2** StudyHall resource viewer tag display:
  - **Header Integration**: TagBoxes component added to resource viewer window header (far left/upper area)
  - **Read-Only Display**: Tags display in compact mode without editing functionality
  - **Dual Data Sources**: Tags load from both active resource workflows
  - **Workflow 1 Fix**: StudyHall Library Resources selection fetches complete tag data via API
  - **Workflow 2 Fix**: LibraryStacks "Load Active Resources" icon includes tags in localStorage data
  - **Clean Interface**: No "Tags:" label - color scheme provides visual identification

**Key Technical Implementation Notes:**
- **localStorage Custom Tags**: `/frontend/src/constants/tagConstants.js` - custom array empty, managed via localStorage
- **TagSettings localStorage Pattern**: 
  ```javascript
  const loadCustomTags = () => JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('customTags') || '[]');
  const saveCustomTags = (tags) => localStorage.setItem('customTags', JSON.stringify(tags));
  ```
- **TagBoxes localStorage Integration**: Custom tags loaded via `localStorage.getItem('customTags')` in `getAvailableTagsForCategory()`
- **Critical Storage Service Fix**: `/backend/services/storage_service.py` - `store_content()` uses dynamic SQL for partial updates to prevent content overwrites
- **StudyHall Tag State Management**: `currentTags` state synchronized with content loading, saving, and API calls
- **Resource Data Enrichment Pattern**: Both `loadActiveResourcesFromStorage()` and `handleResourceSelect()` fetch complete data via `apiService.getContent()` to include tags
- **LibraryStacks Resource Format**: `resourceItem` structure in "Load Active Resources" workflow must include `tags: item.tags || []`
- **TagBoxes Conditional Editing**: `onTagsChange={editingContentId ? handleTagsChange : undefined}` - only editable when content has valid ID

- [x] **4.3.3** StudyHall tag integration testing and validation: ✅ COMPLETED
  - **Edit Window Testing**: Verify tag editing in both new note and imported note workflows
  - **Resource Viewer Testing**: Validate tag display from both active resource loading workflows
  - **Workflow 1 Testing**: Test resource selection from StudyHall Library Resources section (bottom right)
  - **Workflow 2 Testing**: Test "Load Active Resources" icon from LibraryStacks cards
  - **Cross-Integration Testing**: Verify tags persist correctly between library cards and StudyHall
  - **API Validation**: Confirm all tag operations properly save to database without affecting other fields

  - **Multi-Tag Filter Implementation**: FULLY IMPLEMENTED - 3-row stacked column design with:
    - **3 Independent Tag Dropdowns**: Each row has its own tag selection dropdown (max 3 tags)
    - **Individual AND/OR Logic**: Each tag gets its own radio button pair for granular filtering control
    - **Column Headers**: "Filter Tags:", "AND", and "OR" labels for clear user guidance
    - **Space Optimization**: Horizontal space efficiently utilized in header layout
    - **Complex Filter Logic**: Supports queries like "Must have Prayer AND (can have Easter OR Teaching)"
  - **Enhanced Filtering Logic**: COMPLETED
    - **Removed "tag sort" option**: Eliminated confusing tag count + first tag alphabetical approach
    - **Streamlined sort options**: Date, Title, Category (logical and intuitive)
    - **Per-tag operators**: Each filter independently set to AND (required) or OR (optional)
  - **Visual Category Integration**: COMPLETED - Category bubbles in list view match grid view styling, positioned after scripture references
  - **Performance Optimization**: IMPLEMENTED - Efficient loading and rendering with separate content sources for grid vs list views
  - **Smart Content Loading**: Automatic all-category loading when switching to list view, preserves selected category for grid view
